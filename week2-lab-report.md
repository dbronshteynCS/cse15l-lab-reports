## Installing VSCode

To install Visual Studio Code I went to the website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once I was at the Visual Studio Code website I clicked the "Download Mac Universal Stable Build" button because I use macOS. After following the installation prompts, I was able to open Visual Studio Code application.

## Remotely Connecting

To remotely connect to my course-specific account on ieng6, I first went to the website [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) where I logged in using my credentials, went to my course-specific account on ieng6 (cse15lwi22ace), and reset my password to activate the account. Then I went to Visual Studio Code, opened the terminal, and typed in "ssh cse15lwi22ace@ieng6.ucsd.edu". After clicking the *return* key on my computer, I was prompted with "authenticy of host" message, to which I entered "yes", and lastly when prompted for a password, I copied in the password that I created when activating my course-specific account through the password reset.
